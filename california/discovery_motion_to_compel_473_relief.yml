query: discovery motion to compel 473 relief
relevance_criteria: Jerry's Shell and Zellerino are the most cited and are BEST. Other
  cases dealing with a party's motion for 473 relief after a failure to satisfy a
  discovery motion are VERY_GOOD. Cases where the 473 relief is sought because the
  discovery was not permitted (and the party is seeking discovery) are GOOD. Non 473
  relief cases, and cases not relating to discovery are BAD.
