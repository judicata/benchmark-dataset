query: liability of parent for child vandalism
relevance_criteria: "Cynthia mentions a statute dealing with parental liability for\
  \ a child's vandalism. It's not a case of liability for economic damages, though.\
  \ It's probably the BEST result. The VERY_GOOD results are those cases discussing\
  \ parental liability and have the word vandalism. GOOD results are cases about parental\
  \ or guardian liability for a child's economic damages. BAD results are not parental\
  \ liability cases. \r\n\r\nMight benefit from statutory anchors? 1714.1"
