query: is it retaliation if you're fired for not signing a handbook with arbitration
  agreement in it?
relevance_criteria: "This is a good query - difficult, with very few on point results.\
  \ Most case results are about refusal to enforce, not sign.\r\n\r\nBEST cases are\
  \ about someone being fired for not signing arbitration agreement and suing. Note\
  \ (lagatree is actually about wrongful termination and not retaliation, but it's\
  \ close enough to be a great result). VERY_GOOD cases cite discuss BEST cases for\
  \ this rule.\r\n\r\nGOOD cases mention arbitration agreements and termination, but\
  \ nothing about a refusal to sign. BAD cases don't no mention retaliation, termination\
  \ or of arbitration agreement.\r\n"
