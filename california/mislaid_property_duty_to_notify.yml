query: mislaid property duty to notify
relevance_criteria: "This search appears to be about the law of lost and mislaid property.\
  \  The finder is supposed to notify someone that the mislaid property has been notified.\
  \ \r\n\r\nFuller and Pal seem to be reasonably close to on-point. They deal with\
  \ the situation of property mislaid in shops, so they are VERY_GOOD. Other cases\
  \ are GOOD if they deal with a duty to notify or mislaid property. Cases that don't\
  \ deal with either are BAD."
