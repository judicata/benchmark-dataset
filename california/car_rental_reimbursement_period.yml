query: car rental reimbursement period
relevance_criteria: BEST queries are those where there is some issue around the period
  of time when a car rental reimbursement is reasonable. VERY_GOOD cases deal with
  reimbursement of car rental costs. Cases mentioning car rentals and reimbursement
  (but not necessarily about either) are GOOD. Cases not discussing reimbursement
  or car rentals are BAD.
