query: bfoq
relevance_criteria: Johnson Controls is the seminal case on Bona Fide Occupational
  Qualification. VERY_GOOD results are discrimination cases where "bona fide occupational
  qualification" or "bfoq" is a raised issue/defense, and there is discussion/mention
  of the plaintiffs qualifications to perform the jobs duties (which implicates bfoq).
  The GOOD results are those where bfoq is mentioned (for example, in a quote from
  the statute), but is not at issue.
